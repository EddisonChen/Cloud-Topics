Cloud & DevOps
  - The cloud is the hosting and storage of data and services or applications on external servers that are not your own, generally owned by AWS, GCP, or Azure.
  - DevOps is a methodology that focuses on continual delivery and review of software and bridges the gap between development and infrastructure.
  
  - So far, we've created instances on AWS and GCP and hosted APIs and databases in the cloud. Currently, we're working on a project that centers around uploading           trainee profiles as PDFs into a database hosted in AWS. The entire application will also be deployed in AWS.
  - We've also been working on using different tools for automation and deployment of infrastructure, which directly benefits the development of our applications.
  
  - The benefits of cloud is the increased reliability due to the redundancies built into these cloud servers. If a business had an on-premise server, one accident,         fire, or disaster could wipe out the entire company's data or cause their services to go down indefinitely. But with third party servers, even if one goes down, data     and services are stored in multiple locations, ensuring that both data and functionality of services are maintained. Another benefit is the cost, with cloud, you         only pay for the amount of resources that you need.
  - The benefits of DevOps is that software is delivered and reviewed more frequently, which ensures higher quality code and promotes adaptibility, partially because 
    this continuous delivery means that testing happens more frequently. DevOps also brings together the developemnt and operations/infrastrucutre teams, which ensures
    that both teams are on the same page and promotes coordination, which leads to a higher quality product.
